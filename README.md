MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing large amount of data. Instead of using tables and rows, MongoDB uses Collections and documents.

Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language and is considered very convenient to take in if working on Objects. Python is easy to understand beacuase it has english like syntax and does the work in few lines of code.
